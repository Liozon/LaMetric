# LaMetric
Here you'll find different projects around the LaMetric Time connected clock.

Here is a list of what is available:
- Bus: a little app that will check the time of the next departure of the choosed line and display it through remaining minutes and seconds
- News: an app that'll fetch the 5 latest titles of a newspaper through RSS and display them
