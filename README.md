# LaMetric apps

You'll find the following projects:

* **Bus** a little app that will check the time of the next departure of the choosed Swiss line and display it through remaining minutes and seconds
* **Folding@home** an app that displays the statistics of a Folding@home team with WUs, credits and ranking
* **News** an app that'll fetch the 5 latest titles of a newspaper through RSS, convert them into JSON data and display them
