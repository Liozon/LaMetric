# News
The News app is divided in to folders: </br>
The first folder, 'JSON', will fetch the RSS/XML data from the newspaper and will convert them to JSON data. With that being done, it will be easier to parse the document later.

The second folder, 'PHP', will parse the JSON data and construct the data for the LaMetric.

List of current newspapers:
- 20 Minutes
- La Gruyère
- La Liberté
- Le Courrier
