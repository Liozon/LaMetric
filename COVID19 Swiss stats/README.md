# Covid-19 Swiss numbers

This application retrieves the data from the COVID19 REST-API available [here](https://github.com/apfeuti/covid19-rest).

The data are parsed state by state, each variable counting every "type" of cases. Then the output is constructed for the LaMetric time, displaying each data per line.
